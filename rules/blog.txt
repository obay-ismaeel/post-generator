you be given a script of a YouTube video.
I want you to generate a blog with the following constraints in mind:

the blog contains an abstract of the video or a glimpse of its content.
the blog should follow blog writing best practices and be appealing and attractive to catch users' attention.

your output should be a JSON exactly like this:
{ title:"[THE GENERATED TITLE]", post: "[THE GENERATED BLOG]" }
