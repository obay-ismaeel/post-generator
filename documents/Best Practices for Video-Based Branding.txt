Best Practices for Video-Based Branding

n-site residency recruitment interviews
have been considered the ‘‘gold standard’’
for allowing programs and applicants to
assess mutual compatibility and fit.1–3 For the 2020–
2021 interview season, however, the Association of
American of Medical Colleges (AAMC) is strongly
encouraging graduate medical education (GME)
programs to use virtual interviews to mitigate the
risk of COVID-19.4 On-site interviews contribute
significantly to an applicant’s perspectives of a
training program by providing opportunities to
interact with residents and program leadership, to
experience program location and work environment,
and to develop a sense of a program ‘‘feel’’ and how
they ‘‘fit’’ into that program.1 In lieu of traditional
interviews, programs must reimagine how they
communicate information to applicants, describe
culture, and authentically portray the program.
Videos represent a means of consistent information
delivery; however, their design must be optimized to
ensure a strong user experience. We review key
concepts and best practices for the use of video
during virtual residency and fellowship recruitment.

Key Concepts in Branding
Residency programs have already developed a unique
brand, whether intentionally or not. The term brand
is defined as ‘‘a sign certifying the origin of a product
or service and differentiating it from the competition.’’5 Although health systems and residency programs have previously devoted efforts to branding,6,7
virtual recruitment will necessitate additional attention to it (FIGURE). Brand positioning should provide
consistent messages in a clear and appealing format,
including a modern-appearing and fully functional
program website, a strong social media presence, and
online video content that shares a compelling view of
the program. Video-based branding is the use of
videos for brand positioning and is the focus of this
article.

Historically, programs have used several platforms to
display a brand image, including websites, social
media sites such as Twitter, and online communities
such as Reddit.8 Programs have also disseminated
videos via these forums. Programs have then used an
in-person interview to provide a comprehensive brand
experience. As residency programs must now fully
provide the comprehensive brand experience virtually,
they must consider key principles for developing
recruitment videos.
Limit Video Duration: Shorter videos keep an
audience’s attention.9 Business literature suggested
that two-thirds of viewers watch videos to completion
if they are shorter than 1 minute.10 In 2018, the
average marketing video lasted 4.07 minutes.10 While
highlighting key aspects of a program likely necessitates videos longer than 1 minute, we recommend
keeping videos as short as possible, ideally less than 5
minutes.
Limit the Scope of the Video: Each video should have
a clear focus. Comprehensive videos represent significant cognitive load for applicants and risk diluting
key information. We recommend creating multiple
short videos to individually highlight program features to give applicants a ‘‘feel’’ for the program.
Examples include a video demonstrating post-work
activities of residents or faculty and recorded interviews detailing unique aspects of the curriculum.
Include Information About Resident Life: Traditional
interviews include opportunities for applicants to ask
questions to residents. Responses can significantly
affect brand image.1–3,11,12 Losing pre-interview
social events limits applicants’ ability to gather this
information in a low-stakes setting, but programs can
provide similar information in video format. Essential
content may include satisfaction and wellness, cost of
living, and descriptions of the local area, benefits, and
community-building initiatives. Videos featuring a

proves learning and knowledge retention (TABLE).15,16
Balance User-Generated and Program Leadership–
Generated Content: User-generated content is a staple
of business marketing. Consumers regard the content
as authentic and trustworthy,13 and are 5 times more
likely to interact with user-generated content than
with professional content.14 Examples of user-generated content in residency programs include personal
anecdotes and testimonials from current residents,
faculty, and alumni, as well as videos highlighting a
‘‘day-in-the-life’’ of a resident. These videos can be
made without the need for professional equipment—
smartphone videos and pictures often suffice. While
user-generated content is valuable, we recommend
balancing it with high-quality program leadership–
generated content that showcases the curriculum and
sponsoring institution.

Track and Review Video Analytics: Available data
includes the number of viewers, devices from which
the video is viewed, and the time at which viewership
declines. Video hosting websites such as YouTube
readily provide these data. Instagram also has a native
analytics tool that shows audience demographics,
profile engagement, and which posts are most
successful. A member of the recruitment team should
track this data weekly in order to maintain popular
videos, relocate less trafficked ones, and contribute to
future brand auditing.17

TABLE

Mayer’s 12 Principles of Multimedia Learning
Principle

Videos for Residency Program Branding

Example

Avoid segments that do not highlight key
aspects of the program’s brand identity,
even if visually appealing.

Focusing on fellowship placement when the
program doesn’t have many graduates
pursue fellowship.

Signaling

Provide cues to audience prior to showing
critical elements of the brand identity to
recapture attention.

Introduce elements using large or boldly
colored text or modulating tone/volume of
presenter’s voice.

Redundancy

Avoid redundant text on-screen if voice-over
narration provides the same material.

Having text cues that replicate what is being
said.

Spatial and temporal
contiguity

Present corresponding audio/pictures/clips
close together within the video.

Use pictures of residents together outside of
work when speaking about concepts like
wellness or work-life balance.

Segmenting

Avoid clustering critical information within too
short a span of video.

A video places multiple program highlights
within the same minute of the video.

Pretraining

Provide static materials highlighting desired
aspects of the brand identity near the video
link.

Place program’s mission statement or letter
from the program director near video link.

Modality

Use audio voice-over rather than on-screen
text.

Use high-quality microphone to record voiceover.

Multimedia

Video and audio together are more effective
than a single modality alone.

Avoid videos with background music and onscreen text only.

Personalization

Use informal language to connect with
applicants rather than overly technical terms.

Avoid using medical or business jargon during
video.

Voice

During sections with audio, use an expressive
human presenter.

Modulate tone and pace to maintain
audience’s attention.

Image

Presenters during the video do not always
need to be shown while speaking.

Utilize voice-overs, especially if same individual
is consistently speaking.

Social media allows programs to directly engage with
applicants in a dynamic fashion; applicants can ask
questions via comments or direct messages and
receive responses from the program. Social media
accounts can also post videos of residency events,
resident and faculty achievements, and educational
content. Social media analytics as mentioned above
can be used to track engagement with content and
allow programs to optimize efforts.

Pitfalls of Video-Based Branding

Coherence

PERSPECTIVES

Interviewees are limited in who they meet and
speak to on in-person interview days. Therefore, in
future years, videos can be used to expose applicants
to resident and faculty voices that they may not have
met in person or those who have like-minded
interests. This will allow for applicants to develop a
greater understanding of a program’s brand and
culture.2,3,11,12
Further research is needed to determine if applicants value these videos and what, if any, impact
videos have on recruitment.
